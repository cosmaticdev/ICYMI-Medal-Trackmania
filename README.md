Trackmania Openplanet plugin aimed to allow Medal to contextualize gameplay data.

This could possibly allow for enhanced race clipping and/or ICYMI support for Trackmania

This plugin records the following:
- maps being played
- trackmania username for the active user
- when races start and end
- timestamps for when checkpoints are collected (inc. finish)
- when an afk player is detected, and when they return

The end goal is for this data to be used to allow for Medal to make clip lengths based on how long you are racing for, eliminating the need for manually recording withh OBS from a replay file and allowing for near-instant video recordings of your runs

Planned features for a future release:
- support for older trackmania games
- menu option to save clips
